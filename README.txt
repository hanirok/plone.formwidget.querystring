Introduction
============
Initial release, this z3c widget is being used for the contentlisting tile, to make selections,
and 'build' your query. It stores a list of dictionaries containing the query you've build.
This query is being parsed by using plone.app.collection and that used plone.app.contentlisting
to display the results in the tile.
